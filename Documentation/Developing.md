Developing
==========

The app is open-sourced under the Apache License 2.0. So feel free to fork and modify it.<br />
If you have developed a new feature and think that it is completely working, just send me a Pull Request on Github.

Testing locally

To test your work locally you can use your local Web Server. I have authorized the URL "localhost" for testing and developing.
